# What is this ?
This is a code creator for move Wii U functions.    
It creates a specific value which (after being written in the ram of your Wii U) will direct a function to another function.    
If the find part does not work and causes the software to crash then manually choose your type of value by clicking on "(Auto dectect)".    
(Sorry for the bad explanations)    

# How do I compile ? 
You can compile this with [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or with other development software in C#.

# Credits
**nt games** for making the code.
